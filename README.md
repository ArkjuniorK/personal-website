# Personal Website

Interactive terminal-like website as my personal web. Heavily inspired by 
[Aurora](https://github.com/flick0/dotfiles) by [flick0](https://github.com/flick0).
This website is built on top of React and TailwindCSS. Terminal is using 
Xterm.js and run as client only without a backend so commands was defined locally.
Commands can be found at `/src/commands` directory.

Tech:
- Bun
- Vite
- React
- Xterm.js
- Typescript
- TailwindCSS
